# My journey with React Native

This is where I'm putting some of my React Native proyects.

## Table of Contents

| Proyect | Description |
|Shopping List| This proyect is my start with React Native. It shows some pretty simple interface with the ability to add new things to a list with React States.|
|Tesla Clone 1 | This proyect is more visually striking. It's made with Expo and... I didn't like it so I'm basically closing this one up <3 |
|Tesla Clone 2 | This proyect is the same as the last one, BUT made with React Native Vanilla. Here I'm going to implement Navigation and again it's more visually appealing.|

## Conclusion

It's actually been a lot of fun creating different apps as a way for me to practice. The beautiful thing about React Native is its hybrid nature. As a sole developer, I like the idea of creating apps for more than just Android or iOS.
Here's to more apps and little proyects like this <3 !
